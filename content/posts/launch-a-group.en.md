Our group aims to address the situation where developers often find themselves in a state of dismay, thinking, "Oh no... my cloud usage costs are too high!" This situation hinders their ability to fully engage in development activities. In an effort to mitigate this issue, we propose exploring the concept of developing cloud-based systems and applications locally. Our goal is to gather like-minded individuals and create a lively community where we can collectively pursue this approach.

Currently, we are interested in utilizing tools such as localstack and SAM Local available on AWS. We also plan to discuss topics like firecracker. However, considering that many user groups dedicated to specific products have gradually lost momentum and dissolved along with the decline of those products' activities, we have decided to adopt a more inclusive approach. Instead of naming ourselves after a specific product like "Japan Localstack Users Group" or "Japan SAM Local Users Group," we have chosen the name "Cloud Native Local Developers Group" to emphasize our focus on various products while pursuing the aforementioned theme.

We understand that there may be concerns about the appropriateness of our group's name in English. However, rather than getting caught up in the name itself, our primary intention is to commence our activities and welcome suggestions such as, "Wouldn't this name be better?" from our members.
